TL;DR
======

Java port of my wedding website that I wrote in a week in PHP back in 2007 (so please don't judge).

My Wedding Website
========

Upon choosing a destination wedding in Hawaii, I decided to build a site for our wedding guests that included details for the wedding and a RSVP form.  I hacked together something in about a week in PHP on top of MySQL (the only option available with my hosting provider at the time).  The site lived at http://raneeand.jamietsao.com.

The wedding site was sacrificed in 2009 when I moved my main site (http://jamietsao.com) over to Squarespace.  After recently celebrating our 6th anniversary, I decided to resurrect the wedding site.  I wanted to keep the site as it was, so other than porting it from PHP to Java, no other major changes were made.
