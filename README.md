TL;DR
======

A line-for-line (almost) Java port of my wedding website that I wrote in a week in PHP back in 2007 (so please don't judge).

My Wedding Website
========

After choosing to have a destination wedding in Hawaii, I decided to build a site for our wedding guests that included details for the wedding and a RSVP form.  I hacked together something in about a week in PHP on top of MySQL (the only option available with my hosting provider at the time).  The site lived at http://raneeand.jamietsao.com.

After moving my main site (jamietsao.com) over to Squarespace in 2009, the wedding site was sacrificed.  After celebrating our anniversary recently, I decided to resurrect the site.
